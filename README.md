# ADI Visit Structurer

A hybrid NLP pipeline for structuring home-care clinical visit notes into standardized JSON records.

This project was developed during an internship focused on building automated tools for processing and evaluating structured medical data extracted from narrative clinical notes.

---

## Overview

Clinical home-care visit notes often contain unstructured information such as:

- reason for visit
- vital signs
- follow-up instructions
- interventions
- clinical problems

This project automatically extracts and normalizes these elements into a structured format suitable for downstream analysis, reporting, and validation.

The system combines **rule-based extraction** with **LLM-assisted extraction** to improve accuracy and coverage.

---

## Pipeline Architecture

The pipeline processes each visit note through several stages:

### 1. Preprocessing
- text normalization
- cleaning and segmentation

### 2. Rule-based extraction
Extract structured fields using pattern matching and domain rules:

- vital signs
- interventions
- reasons for visit

### 3. LLM extraction (Hybrid Mode)

For more complex information, the pipeline uses a **local LLM**:

- **Llama 3 running via Ollama**

This improves extraction of nuanced clinical descriptions.

### 4. Problem normalization
Extracted conditions are mapped to normalized labels.

### 5. Schema validation
Outputs are validated using a predefined **JSON schema** to ensure structural consistency.

### 6. Evaluation
Predictions are compared with **gold annotations** to measure extraction performance.

## Example Output

Each visit note is converted into structured JSON:

```json
{
  "clinical": {
    "reason_for_visit": "...",
    "follow_up": "...",
    "interventions": [],
    "vitals": {
      "blood_pressure_systolic": null,
      "blood_pressure_diastolic": null,
      "heart_rate": null,
      "temperature": null,
      "spo2": null
    }
  },
  "coding": {
    "problems_normalized": []
  }
}

## Installation

Install project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Running the Pipeline

Run the extraction pipeline:

```bash
python -m src.run_pipeline --hybrid
```

Evaluate predictions:

```bash
python -m src.evaluate
```

---

## Reports

Evaluation results are exported to the `reports/` folder.

Key outputs include:

* `metrics.json`
* `summary_table.csv`
* `dashboard.html`

The dashboard provides a visual summary of pipeline performance.
